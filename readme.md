Bubble Sort Algorithm
This is a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python.

Overview
Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Implementation
The Bubble Sort algorithm is implemented in Python in the bubble_sort.py file. The main loop iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Usage
Clone this repository or download the bubble_sort.py file.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing bubble_sort.py.
Run the script using the command: python bubble_sort.py.
The script will sort the list some_numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and print the sorted list along with the number of iterations it took to sort the list.

Complexity
The time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of extra space.
